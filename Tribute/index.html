      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Audi Sport Quattro S1 is a rally car that was introduced in 1984
        as an update to the Audi Quattro and was used as a Group B rally car.
        It was introduced at the same time as the Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4 and Ford RS200.
        The S1 featured an alloy 2,133 cc (130.2 cu in) (2.1 L) 20v DOHC engine slightly smaller than that of the Audi
        Quattro (in order to qualify for the 3-litre engine class after the scale factor applied to turbo engines).
